{"text":"The New Coke campaign in the 1980s was met with extreme backlash from consumers, and the company ended up pulling the campaign off of the market. The main reason that the New Coke campaign failed so spectacularly is due to the fact that the company decided to remove the unique formula that made Coca-Cola the iconic brand that it was known as, and replaced it with a generic formula. Since consumers could not discern the difference between the new and original formula, the company decided to remove the iconic formula and replaced it with a new formula. This caused tremendous backlash from consumers, and the company ultimately decided to pull the campaign off of the market. The rationale for changing the Coca-Cola formula in the first place was because the company wanted to test a new formulation of the Coca-Cola recipe. The new formula contained fresh fruit flavors, and consumers were able to discern a difference between the new formula and the original formula. The new formula was harder to manufacture, so the Coca-Cola company delayed the roll-out of the new formula to ensure that the company could scale up the manufacturing of the existing formula, in order to meet consumer demand for the new formula. Ultimately, the company decided to pull the new formula off of the market and replaced it with the original formula. Overall, the Coca-Cola company made a major mistake by changing the Coca-Cola formula, and the New Coke campaign was one of the biggest flops in advertising history.","model":"dolly","source":"reddit","id":21293,"label":1}

Our study aims to provide a rigorous analysis of the relationship between the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function and certain special functions known as Euler products. The Riemann Hypothesis, one of the fundamental unsolved problems in mathematics, states that all non-trivial zeroes of the zeta function lie on the critical line of the complex plane. Our research attempts to establish a connection between the presence of zeroes of certain finite Euler products and the distribution of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.\n\nWe have derived new results that establish the existence of unexpected zero-free regions for finite Euler products. We have demonstrated that certain algebraic expressions, referred to as approximate functional identities, can yield information on the number of zeroes of the Riemann zeta function within certain rectangles in the complex plane. Our methodology involves techniques from complex analysis, number theory, and representation theory.\n\nOverall, our findings provide new insights into the relationship between the Riemann Hypothesis and Euler products and have potential implications for related problems in number theory.","model":"chatGPT","source":"arxiv","id":39993,"label":0}
{"text":"Coral is a fascinating organism that plays a vital role in maintaining the biodiversity of our planet. These creatures live in a delicate balance of temperature, light, nutrients, and water quality, and small variations in one of these factors can cause serious harm to their survival.\n\nDespite this sensitivity to environmental changes, coral has managed to survive Earth's changing climatic history by adapting to different conditions over time. For example, during the last ice age, coral reefs formed in deep waters, where temperatures were stable, and blue-green algae provided the corals with the critical nutrients it needed to grow. After the ice age, when sea levels rose, coral reefs migrated to shallower waters where sunlight was more abundant, and small fish helped to distribute nutrients.\n\nThese adaptations allowed coral to survive fluctuations in temperature and changes in water quality over time, but climate change now looms as an existential threat to coral itself. With the planet's temperature continuing to rise, coral reefs are under enormous stress, with the potential to cause death and disease on a global scale. The future of coral depends on taking action to reduce carbon emissions and address the causes of climate change.

{"text":"Solar coronal loops are hot, tenuous plasma strands that extend from the surface of the Sun all the way to the coronal arcade, typically at a constant temperature of 1-2 MK. Since coronal loops are the site of much of the Sun\u2019s magnetic activity, their proper stability and dynamic behavior are of crucial interest to both solar physics and space weather. A loop is most stably in pressure balance at its apex where the magnetic pressure equals the plasma pressure. However, in practice, coronal loops have much flatter pressure gradients in the lower parts of their structure. This necessitates the use of an energy principle to determine the dynamic behavior of these structures. Thermodynamic energy principles can be used to determine the dynamic behavior of a coronal loop. The first law of thermodynamics can be formulated such that: dU = q - W + \\sum_i{a_i}, where dU is the energy added or removed through parallel transport along a field line, q is theheat added or removed through footpoint motions at the loop top, W is the work done by forces along the field line, and the sum is over the individual volumes V_i bounded by the field lines. The second law of thermodynamics, in conjunction with the Maxwell equation, can be used to formulate the Maxwell stress as an irreversible energy flux: T \\cdot Ds = \\sum_i{\\frac{1}{2}\\kappa(T_i - T_0)^2}, where T is the temperature, Ds is the conjugated rate of change of entropy, \\kappa is the heat conductivity, and T0 is the background temperature. This second law equation can be used to compute the rate of energy flux through a boundary. If it is positive-definite, then this is an irreversible energy flux into the region bounded by the boundary. The stability of a coronal loop is then determined by the sign of this energy flux at its apex. If this energy flux is positive (negative) then the loop is unstable (stable) with respect to small disturbances. When comparing the stability of two different solutions of the heat conduction equation, the loop is most unstable to kink (wavenumber 2) disturbances. The ratio of the maximum growth rates of the kink and sausage (wavenumbers 1 and 2) modes is the Boyd index. The loops analyzed in this paper have a Boyd index of <1, suggesting that it is unstable to kink oscillations. The computed loop modes agree well with loop observables: computed sausage mode periods are consistent with Doppler shifts of transverse oscillations, and computed kink mode periods are consistent with the long coronal loop lifetimes. By using an energy principle to determine the loop\u2019s dynamic behavior, this research identifies the most likely mechanism by which coronal loops are kink unstable. This research also provides a general framework for determining the dynamic stability of magnet","model":"dolly","source":"arxiv","id":62176,"label":1}

{"text":"This statement by Richard Feynman is true in the current state of knowledge in physics, however there are a couple of examples where we do have a clear picture of what energy looks like. The first is the Photon, whose most famous property is that it has no mass. This means that it does not resist the force of gravity, and instead is able to travel at the speed of light. The Photon is the exchange particle of the electromagnetic force, and all forms of energy are Transformed into Photons as they travel. The Photon therefore acts as an ideal representation of energy. The second example is the QCD Particle, which is the underlying force that binds together the particles that make up a proton or a neutron. Since protons are made of up valence quarks and the force between these particles is mediated by the exchange of gluons, the QCD particle is the gluon. Because these particles are made of energy, we see that energy can be clearly represented in modern physics. Both of these examples are part of the underlying theory that forms our current model of reality, the Standard Model. The theory itself says very little about what energy is or how it works, and as a result leaves that up to further discovery. The goal of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is to find out more about this energy that we talk about so vaguely, and possibly find a new force or new particles. If new particles are found, they might provide a clearer picture of how energy is transformed, and provide direct evidence of the hypothesis that energy is composed of smaller units called Quarks. If no new particles are found, this might suggest that the current model of the Standard Model is incomplete, and that further theory will need to be developed to fill in the gaps.","model":"dolly","source":"reddit","id":22881,"label":1}
{"text":"The Serpens Molecular Cloud complex is located within the view of both the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). These two datasets allow us to trace the history of star formation in this cloud complex over a wide range of wavelengths. First, the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of each YSO candidate was fit with an outer hullien-layer dusty disk plus a nearly dust-free stellar photosphere. These fits are compared to simultaneously observed broadband magnitudes in order to identify likely young stellar objects (YSOs). The resulting Serpens YSO candidate list was then used as the input for a series of Monte Carlo simulations which generate a complete distribution of spectral types for Serpens YSOs. These simulations suggest that Serpens contains about 1,500 YSOs with visible disks, spread across at least six distinct age clusters. The global properties of these Serpens YSOs appear consistent with the previously characterized relation between disk frequency and age in which the Serpens stars exhibit the highest disk frequency of all known star-forming regions. In addition, the Serpens YSOs exhibit the full range of SED classifications, including those with little or no near-infrared excess (Class III objects), consistent with the picture that Serpens contains not only fully accrete objects, but also those in which significant circumstellar material has been removed by, for example, winds from the central stars.","model":"dolly","source":"arxiv","id":31031,"label":1}

{"text":"Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we examine the connection between the sSFR (specific star-formation rate), stellar mass, dark-matter halo mass and the color and presence of a hard-spectrum nucleus in early-type galaxies (ETGs). We find that the sSFR and stellar mass of the central host galaxies are tightly correlated, with high sSFR galaxies being more massive. By splitting our sample into red and blue subsamples using the D\u03b1* diagram, we see a clear link between the presence of a nucleus and the sSFR of the host galaxy. Significantly more red ETGs have a hard-spectrum nucleus compared to blue ETGs at a high confidence level. We also find that the fraction of ETGs with a hard-spectrum nucleus is dependent on the stellar mass of the host galaxy, with low-mass hosts having a significantly lower probability of hosting a nucleus. These results imply that central black-hole growth and star-formation are either causally linked or co-regulated. By plotting the average fraction of each population in each bin of the D\u03b1* diagram, we show that the transition between blue and red galaxies occurs at a higher specific star-formation rate in more massive dark-matter halos. Using semi-analytic models, we explore two co-evolutionary models in which the central black hole and host galaxies are either completely decoupled or co-evolve following the growth of the host galaxy. We find that the latter model provides a better fit to our observations.","model":"dolly","source":"arxiv","id":31662,"label":1}

{"text":"Our research is motivated by the need to better understand the complex process of protein folding and the role of network structures in this process. Protein folding is a fundamental process that determines the function of proteins in biological systems. However, the folding of proteins is a complex process that involves a vast number of possible conformations, which makes it challenging to predict the native structure of a protein. \n\nIn this work, we aim to develop a better understanding of the network structure of protein folding pathways. Our research attempts to solve the problem of predicting and understanding protein folding pathways and the factors that influence these pathways. We employ a diverse set of tools, including simulation methods, computational algorithms, and statistical analysis, to build and analyze protein folding networks. \n\nOur key idea is that protein folding pathways can be represented as networks, where nodes represent protein conformations, and links represent the transitions between these conformations. This representation provides a powerful framework for analyzing protein folding pathways and identifying the key factors that influence the folding process. Our methodology involves developing novel computational tools and using these tools to analyze protein folding networks generated from both experimental and computational data. \n\nOverall, our work seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the complex process of protein folding and the role of network structures in this process. Ultimately, we hope that our research will contribute to the development of new approaches for predicting protein structures and better understanding the functional properties of proteins.","model":"chatGPT","source":"arxiv","id":40405,"label":0}

Additionally, the paper also seeks to distinguish the joint space from the workspace and investigate the special characteristics which can be observed in the latter. A 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator is taken as an example to demonstrate how the notion of aspect, as defined by Borrel in 1986 for serial manipulators, can be connected to these manipulators. The research further reveals that the distinction of characteristic surfaces can distinguish the workspace into its basic regions, thus unveiling the occurrence of new uniqueness domains. An octree model of spaces is then used to analyse the joint space, the workspace, and the sets identified above.","model":"davinci","source":"arxiv","id":34396,"label":0}

{"text":"The atmosphere is thinner at higher elevations so there are fewer molecules of gas to absorb heat from your body's surface. The lower density also means that less energy can be transferred between particles by collisions (i.e., conduction). This makes convection currents weaker which reduces how much warmth they carry up with them into cooler regions above where you're standing. It gets colder because there's not enough oxygen or water vapor left over after all those other gases have been removed during compression.  It's actually warmer on Earth than space but it's still very cold compared to what you'd find near Earth's core due to its distance from the Sun.   Space doesn't really get any colder; if anything, temperatures tend to rise slightly closer to the center of our galaxy since gravity pulls more matter towards us.

{"text":"Metallic systems may exhibit superconductivity by several different routes. The electron-phonon interaction, which is believed to be the primary mechanism of phonon-mediated superconductivity in conventional superconductors, requires the electrons to be sufficiently mobile to carry out repeated lattice vibrations. The strongest electron-phonon coupling occurs in systems with linear lattices, like solid crystals, but strong electron interactions can also generate superconductivity in more amorphous systems, such as the metals made famous by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and Robert Schrieffer, who are rightly known as superfluid metals. While the electrons in these metals are well-coupled to their lattice, the phonon spectra remains gapped, and so the conventional wisdom has been that strong electron-electron interactions are required to develop superconducting instability. However, new theoretical work has proposed that sufficiently asymmetric electron and phonon systems can generate attractive electron-phonon coupling even at nonzero phonon frequencies, and that this asymmetric coupling can generate a robustly stable superconducting ground state even in systems with well-defined quasiparticles. These predictions have been successfully demonstrated by parallel transport calculations on representative real materials, which revealed that the electron-phonon coupling in these materials is asymmetric by more than 20%","model":"dolly","source":"arxiv","id":32484,"label":1}

{"text":"Neutron--proton scattering is one of the fundamental interactions in the universe. The low-energy parameters of the neutron--proton interaction describing low-energy effective interactions in the scattering domain are of crucial importance for various nuclear, particle, and astrophysical phenomena. These low-energy parameters are usually determined by a comparison of the phase shifts of the partial waves of the neutron--proton scattering derived in the effective-field-theory framework with the corresponding experimental data. In this paper, a procedure for determination of the neutron--proton scattering low-energy parameters on the basis of the modern experimental data from partial-wave analyses is proposed. The suggested procedure includes the following steps. First, a database of all available phase-shift data with a fit to all the data is generated. Second, all the data are divided into four energy regions. In each of the energy regions, the parameters of the two-parameter potential model are adjusted to the phase-shift data with an error estimation. Third, the sum of the squared residuals is calculated for each data set. Fourth, the obtained sums are fitted to the functional form, and the parameters of the function are adjusted. Fifth, the procedure is applied for the four energy regions considered. The proposed procedure was applied to phase-shift data on the basis of the most up-to-date partial-wave analyses by the GWU, CSFL, and IUF groups. The performed fits gave the following values of the neutron--proton scattering low-energy parameters: {C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C7, C8} = {0.0726, -0.0748, 0.0023, -0.0032, 0.0069, -0.00028, -0.00058, 0.00004} fm-3. The reliability of the obtained results was verified by performing a root-mean-square analysis and calculating the corresponding statistical characteristics of the fitted parameters. The obtained results for the low-energy parameters are in a good agreement with the current recommendations of the Nijmegen group and the latest calculations performed within the EFT framework. The performed analysis also demonstrated that the energy regions around the K- and P-wave phase shifts provide the most accurate determination of the corresponding low-energy parameters.","model":"dolly","source":"arxiv","id":31312,"label":1}
